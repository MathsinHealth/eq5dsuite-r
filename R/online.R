# data, so it stays out of eq5dsuite::. The app and DEPLOY.md reach it through

#' Settings for the app's online mode
#'
#' The Shiny app runs in one of two modes. Locally -- the default -- it behaves
#' as it always has. Deployed on a public server it limits what can be
#' uploaded, keeps every file it writes inside a per-session folder, ends idle
#' sessions, and tells the user what happens to their data.
#'
#' @details
#' Online mode is off unless it is asked for, by
#' \code{run_app(online = TRUE)} or by setting \code{EQ5DSUITE_ONLINE=true} in
#' the environment the app starts in. The argument wins over the environment
#' variable.
#'
#' Each limit can be set with an R option or an environment variable, the
#' option taking precedence:
#'
#' \tabular{lll}{
#'   \strong{setting} \tab \strong{option} \tab \strong{environment} \cr
#'   maximum upload, MB \tab \code{eq5dsuite.max_upload_mb} \tab \code{EQ5DSUITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB} \cr
#'   maximum rows \tab \code{eq5dsuite.max_rows} \tab \code{EQ5DSUITE_MAX_ROWS} \cr
#'   maximum columns \tab \code{eq5dsuite.max_cols} \tab \code{EQ5DSUITE_MAX_COLS} \cr
#'   idle timeout, minutes \tab \code{eq5dsuite.idle_minutes} \tab \code{EQ5DSUITE_IDLE_MINUTES} \cr
#'   accepted file types \tab \code{eq5dsuite.allowed_types} \tab \code{EQ5DSUITE_ALLOWED_TYPES} \cr
#'   online mode \tab \code{eq5dsuite.online} \tab \code{EQ5DSUITE_ONLINE}
#' }
#'
#' The defaults are 10 MB, 50,000 rows, 200 columns, 30 minutes, and CSV and
#' Excel files. \code{.rds} is deliberately not accepted online: reading a
#' serialised R object from an untrusted source is not a safe operation. It
#' remains accepted locally.
#'
#' See \code{DEPLOY.md} in the installed package
#' (\code{system.file("shiny", "DEPLOY.md", package = "eq5dsuite")}) for what
#' the server itself has to be told.
#'
#' @param online Whether online mode is on. \code{NULL} (default) resolves it
#'   from the \code{eq5dsuite.online} option, then \code{EQ5DSUITE_ONLINE}.
#' @return A list: \code{enabled}, \code{max_upload_mb}, \code{max_rows},
#'   \code{max_cols}, \code{idle_minutes} and \code{allowed_types}. The limits
#'   are reported whether or not online mode is on, so a deployment can check
