#' @title eqxw
#' @description Get crosswalk values
#' @param x A vector of 5-digit EQ-5D-5L state indexes or a matrix/data.frame with columns corresponding to EQ-5D state dimensions
#' @param country A country code or value set code identifying the value set
#'   to use, as listed by \code{eqvs_display()}. Matching is case-insensitive.
#'   For countries with more than one value set (for example Germany, with
#'   \code{"DE_TTO"} and \code{"DE_VAS"}), the value set code must be
#'   given; supplying the country code alone raises an error listing the
#'   available codes.
#' @param dim.names A vector of dimension names to identify dimension columns
#' @return A numeric vector of crosswalk values, or a data.frame with one
#'   column per crosswalk set requested. The result is an unnamed numeric vector, one element per
#'   element or row of \code{x} and in the same order.
#' @examples 
#' eqxw(c(11111, 12521, 32123, 55555), 'US')

#' @title eqxw_UK
#' @description Map EQ-5D-5L health states, or mean EQ-5D-5L values, to EQ-5D
#'   values based on the UK EQ-5D-3L value set (Dolan 1997), using the mapping
#'   published by the NICE Decision Support Unit (Hernández Alava et al. 2023).
#'
#' @details
#' NICE's interim methods statement of 27 August 2026 (NICE 2026, PMG51) makes
#' the UK EQ-5D-5L value set the reference case: EQ-5D-5L data collected in a
#' study should be valued directly with it, that is
#' \code{eq5d5l(x, country = "GB")}. The statement applies to topics started
#' after it was published -- for technology appraisals, those whose invitation
#' to participate was issued after that date. For topics started before it,
#' NICE says EQ-5D-5L data should continue to be mapped to EQ-5D-3L utility
#' values, which is what \code{eqxw_UK()} does; it also reproduces earlier
#' analyses. (Checked against the statement on 4 October 2026; NICE's methods
#' manuals PMG36 and PMG20 are to be updated to match it.)
#'
#' The mapping is age- and sex-specific. It is not the crosswalk of van Hout et
#' al. (2012) implemented in \code{\link{eqxw}}, and it is not the reverse
#' crosswalk of van Hout and Shaw (2021) implemented in \code{\link{eqxwr}};
#' those take neither age nor sex. See \code{\link{eqxwr_UK}} for the opposite
#' direction.
#'
#' \subsection{Two kinds of input}{
#' \strong{Health states}, for individual respondents. Give \code{x} as 5-digit
#' EQ-5D-5L state indexes, or as a matrix or data frame with one column per
#' dimension. Each respondent's state, age and sex are looked up directly and
#' \code{bwidth} is ignored. This is the usual case.
#'
#' \strong{EQ-5D values}, for a \emph{mean} value such as one reported in a
#' published study. Give \code{x} as values on the UK EQ-5D-5L value set. There
#' is no unique health state behind a mean, so the mapped value is a weighted
#' average of the mapped values of the states whose EQ-5D value lies near it,
#' using an Epanechnikov kernel of half-width \code{bwidth} within the age band
#' and sex given. Set \code{bwidth = "default"} to apply the DSU's recommended
#' bandwidths for mean values: 0.1 for values above 0.6, and 0.4 for values at
#' or below 0.6. \strong{This input is not intended for individual-level data};
#' map individual respondents from their health states.
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Age and sex}{
#' Both are required. Age is used in years and grouped into the five bands of
#' the mapping: 16-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65 or over. There is no upper
#' limit. Ages below 16 are outside the estimation sample and return \code{NA}
#' with a warning; values of 1 to 5 are treated as ages, never as band numbers.
#' Sex must be 1 for male and 0 for female; \code{TRUE} and \code{FALSE} are
#' accepted. Any other value returns \code{NA} with a warning.
#' }
#'
#' Invalid or missing health states, ages or sexes return \code{NA}.
#'
#' @param x EQ-5D-5L health states, as a vector of 5-digit state indexes or as a
#'   matrix or data frame with one column per EQ-5D dimension; or a vector of
#'   mean EQ-5D values on the UK EQ-5D-5L value set. See Details.
#' @param age Age in years, as a vector or, when \code{x} is a data frame, the
#'   name of a column in it.
#' @param male 1 for male and 0 for female (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} are
#'   accepted), as a vector or, when \code{x} is a data frame, a column name.
#' @param dim.names A vector of dimension names to identify dimension columns.
#' @param bwidth Kernel half-width, used only for value input. \code{0} (the
#'   default) matches values exactly. \code{"default"} applies the DSU's
#'   recommended bandwidths for mean values.
#' @return An unnamed numeric vector of mapped EQ-5D values, one per row of
#'   \code{x} and in the same order.
