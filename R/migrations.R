#' Apply pending value set migrations
#'
#' Fetches the migrations index from the repository and applies
#' any renames that have not yet been applied locally. This
#' ensures that value set codes remain consistent when a country
#' publishes a second value set and the original code needs to
#' be disambiguated with a year suffix.
#'
#' Migrations are applied before checking for new value sets in
#' \code{update_value_sets()}, ensuring the local state is
#' consistent before any new installations.
#'
#' A migration is recorded as applied only when its outcome is verified: the
#' old code is gone and the new one is there, or there was nothing to rename.
#' When both codes are installed -- the target already exists -- nothing is
#' renamed or deleted, the migration is a conflict, and it stays pending: two
#' different value sets cannot be merged without a policy that says how.
#' Codes are compared without regard to case, as lookups are.
#'
#' A rename that was made but whose record (\code{applied_migrations.rds})
#' could not be saved is kept, and the status is \code{"unrecorded"}. The
#' migration stays pending; on the next run its old code is gone, so it is
#' recorded without renaming anything again.
#'
#' @param ask Logical. Whether to ask for confirmation before
#'   applying migrations. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @return Invisibly, a list: \code{status} (\code{"ok"}, \code{"conflict"},
#'   \code{"failed"}, \code{"unrecorded"} or \code{"postponed"}),
#'   \code{applied} (migration ids whose outcome holds now), \code{recorded}
#'   (those of them saved as applied), \code{conflicts} and \code{failed}
