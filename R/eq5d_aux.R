It also reports the total sample size and the number (and proportion) of missing values for each FU. 
#' The input `df` must contain an ordered FU variable and the continuous variable of interest. 
#' The name of the continuous variable must be specified using `name_v`. 
#' The wrapper is used in Table 3.1 (for VAS) or Table 4.2 (for EQ-5D utility)

#' The kurtosis is **non-excess**: a normal distribution gives 3, not 0. The
#' row is labelled "Kurtosis (non-excess)" so that the output says which
#' convention it uses. Stata's \code{summarize, detail} reports the same
