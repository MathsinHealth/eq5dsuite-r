# Deploying the eq5dsuite Shiny app on Shiny Server

For the open-source edition of Shiny Server, serving the app at its own
address. Other platforms are covered briefly at the end.

The app runs in one of two modes.

**Locally** — the default — it is a tool on your own machine. There are no
limits, nothing is hidden, and your data never leave the computer.

**Online** it is a shared service. It limits what can be uploaded, keeps every
file it writes inside a folder belonging to that session alone, ends idle
sessions, sanitises errors, and tells the user what happens to their data.

Nothing about the analyses differs between the two.

---

## 1. The application directory

Shiny Server runs the application directory itself. That means `app.R` must
**return** the application, not start it: `run_app()` calls `runApp()`, and
`runApp()` inside `runApp()` is an error Shiny refuses by name. Use
`eq5d_app()`, which hands back the app object with the online settings already
in force.

It is written `eq5dsuite:::eq5d_app()`, with three colons, throughout this
guide. That is deliberate: the app's supporting functions are internal to the
package rather than part of the interface a user analysing EQ-5D data sees, so
`eq5dsuite::eq5d_app()` with two colons will not find it. Copy the three
colons exactly.

```
/srv/shiny-server/eq5d/app.R
```

```r
eq5dsuite:::eq5d_app(online = TRUE)
```

That is the whole file. Limits and wording come from the options and
environment variables in section 3.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/shiny-server/eq5d
sudo chown -R shiny:shiny /srv/shiny-server/eq5d
```

eq5dsuite and its dependencies must be installed somewhere the `shiny` user can
read — the site library, not a personal one:

```bash
sudo R -e 'install.packages(c("shiny","bslib","DT","readxl","rmarkdown","zip","writexl"))'
sudo R -e 'install.packages("eq5dsuite")'
```

`pandoc` is needed for the Word report. It ships with RStudio Server; on a
server without it, `sudo apt install pandoc`.

Check the app loads as the `shiny` user before wiring anything up:

```bash
sudo -u shiny R -e 'print(class(eq5dsuite:::eq5d_app(online = TRUE)))'
# [1] "shiny.appobj"
```

---

## 2. `shiny-server.conf`

`/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`:

```
run_as shiny;

# One R process serves every session of an app, so keep it modest and let it
# be reaped promptly when the last person leaves.
simple_scheduler 20;
app_idle_timeout 30;
app_init_timeout 120;

# Defence in depth: the app sets this itself in online mode.
sanitize_errors true;

# Logs are written per process and removed when it exits cleanly. Leave that
# alone unless you are debugging - see section 6.
preserve_logs false;

server {
  listen 3838 127.0.0.1;        # behind the proxy only, never public

  location / {
    app_dir /srv/shiny-server/eq5d;
    log_dir /var/log/shiny-server;
  }
}
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server
```

Directive names have changed between Shiny Server versions; check yours
against the admin guide for the version you have installed.

### `simple_scheduler` is the thing to understand

The open-source edition has one scheduler. **A single R process serves every
session of the app**, up to `simple_scheduler` concurrent connections. Three
consequences, and they shape everything below:

- **Memory is shared.** Every session's uploaded data, working copy and saved
  results live in one process. At the default 50,000-row limit, allow roughly
  150 MB per active session. `simple_scheduler 20` with 50,000-row datasets can
  reach several gigabytes; lower the scheduler, the row limit, or both, and
  watch it under load.
- **Value sets are shared.** See section 4.
- **`tempdir()` is shared.** The app already keeps each session's files in a
  subdirectory of its own and deletes them when the session ends, which is why
  that matters — see section 5.

`app_idle_timeout 30` reaps the process 30 seconds after the last person
disconnects, which also clears whatever was in memory. Do **not** set it to
`0`: that means never.

---

## 3. Settings

Each is read from an R option first, then an environment variable, then the
default.

| what | option | environment variable | default |
|---|---|---|---|
| online mode | `eq5dsuite.online` | `EQ5DSUITE_ONLINE` | off |
| maximum upload, MB | `eq5dsuite.max_upload_mb` | `EQ5DSUITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `10` |
| maximum rows | `eq5dsuite.max_rows` | `EQ5DSUITE_MAX_ROWS` | `50000` |
| maximum columns | `eq5dsuite.max_cols` | `EQ5DSUITE_MAX_COLS` | `200` |
| idle timeout, minutes | `eq5dsuite.idle_minutes` | `EQ5DSUITE_IDLE_MINUTES` | `30` |
| accepted file types | `eq5dsuite.allowed_types` | `EQ5DSUITE_ALLOWED_TYPES` | `csv,xlsx,xls` |

`app.R` already passes `online = TRUE`, so `EQ5DSUITE_ONLINE` is not needed.
Set the limits alongside it, in the same file, where they are visible to
whoever reads it next:

```r
options(
  eq5dsuite.max_rows     = 25000,
  eq5dsuite.max_upload_mb = 8,
  eq5dsuite.idle_minutes = 20
)
eq5dsuite:::eq5d_app(online = TRUE)
```

Check what a deployment will apply without starting it:

```bash
sudo -u shiny R -e 'str(eq5dsuite:::eq5d_online_config(online = TRUE))'
```

The row and column limits are checked **after the file is read**, so they hold
whatever the browser allowed through. The type is checked on the server too,
not only by the file picker.

The defaults are a starting point. The row limit is not about speed — the PCHC
table takes 0.25 s at 50,000 rows and 0.69 s at 200,000 — but about memory in
the one shared process. Revisit the numbers after load testing.

### `.rds` is not accepted online

Reading a serialised R object from an untrusted source is not a safe
operation. `.rds` is accepted locally and not online, and that is deliberate.
Adding `rds` to `EQ5DSUITE_ALLOWED_TYPES` would undo it; don't.

### The wording users see

The three notices — what happens to uploaded data, the line beside the file
picker, and the pointer to running the app locally — are in one function and
replaced without touching the app. Put your data protection officer's final
text in `app.R`:

```r
options(
  eq5dsuite.online.notice.data   = "...",
  eq5dsuite.online.notice.upload = "...",
  eq5dsuite.online.notice.local  = "..."
)
```

`eq5dsuite:::eq5d_online_notice("data")` shows what is currently in force.

---

## 4. Value sets are shared by the whole process

This is the one thing about the app that does not behave per session, and the
open-source Shiny Server is where it matters most.

Value sets live in an environment held in `options("eq.env")`, which belongs to
the **R process**. With `simple_scheduler`, one process serves every session of
the app. A value set added by one session would be visible to every other
session in that process until it was reaped, and a value set written to the
cache would persist for every session afterwards.

So the online app must never add, change or remove a value set. It doesn't: its
only value-set call is `eqvs_display()`, to list what is available, and a test
asserts that `eqvs_add()`, `eqvs_drop()` and `update_value_sets()` appear
nowhere in it. `update_value_sets()` refuses outright while the app is online.

**Update value sets from outside the app**, as the user that runs it, then
restart:

```bash
sudo -u shiny R -e 'eq5dsuite::update_value_sets()'
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server
```

The cache is at `tools::R_user_dir("eq5dsuite", "cache")` — for the `shiny`
user, `~shiny/.cache/R/eq5dsuite`. The app needs to read it, not write it.

---

## 5. Temporary files

Everything the app writes goes into a `tempfile()` directory inside the
session, deleted in `session$onSessionEnded()`. Nothing is written to the
application directory, and no path is ever built from an uploaded file's name.

That covers an orderly exit. A process killed outright leaves its directory
behind, so clean up periodically. `/etc/cron.daily/eq5d-tmp`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
find /tmp -maxdepth 2 -name 'eq5d*' -mmin +720 -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/eq5d-tmp
```

If `/tmp` is on disk and you would rather uploaded data never touched it, give
the service memory-backed storage:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit shiny-server
```

```
[Service]
PrivateTmp=true
```

`PrivateTmp` also hides the app's temporary files from every other service on
the machine. Note that it changes where the files are, so the cron job above
becomes unnecessary — systemd discards the private `/tmp` when the service
stops.

---

## 6. Logs

Shiny Server writes one log per R process to `/var/log/shiny-server/`, removed
when the process exits cleanly (`preserve_logs false`).

The app keeps uploaded data out of them: `shiny.sanitize.errors` is set in
online mode, so an uncaught error reaches the browser as a generic message; and
the analysis warnings — the follow-up one names values from the uploaded file —
are shown to the person who uploaded it and muffled rather than written to
stderr.

Even so, **treat these logs as potentially sensitive**. Do not ship them to a
shared aggregator without checking what reaches them, and leave
`preserve_logs false` unless you are actively debugging.

---

## 7. The web address

Shiny Server speaks plain HTTP and has **no authentication and no TLS** in the
open-source edition. Anyone with the address can use the app. That is
acceptable here only because the app stores nothing — but it means the proxy in
front of it does the TLS, and you should decide deliberately whether the
address should be discoverable.

nginx, `/etc/nginx/sites-available/eq5d`:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name eq5d.example.org;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/eq5d.example.org/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/eq5d.example.org/privkey.pem;

  # At least the app's own limit, or the upload fails before the app sees it.
  client_max_body_size 12m;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3838;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    # Shiny needs the websocket, and it must outlive an idle session or the
    # app's own one-minute warning never appears.
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    proxy_send_timeout 3600s;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
```

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/eq5d /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

`client_max_body_size` must be at least `EQ5DSUITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB`; a little
above it, so the app's own message is what the user sees rather than a 413 from
nginx.

Check the firewall allows 443 and **not** 3838 — `listen 3838 127.0.0.1` in
section 2 already binds Shiny Server to the loopback, which is the belt to
that braces.

## 8. Before going live

- [ ] `sudo -u shiny R -e 'class(eq5dsuite:::eq5d_app(online = TRUE))'` says `shiny.appobj`
- [ ] `eq5dsuite:::eq5d_online_config(online = TRUE)` reports the limits you meant
- [ ] `simple_scheduler` and the row limit suit the memory the box has
- [ ] nginx's `client_max_body_size` is above the app's upload limit
- [ ] 3838 is not reachable from outside; 443 is, with a valid certificate
- [ ] the final data-protection wording is in `app.R`
- [ ] value sets are up to date, updated from outside the app
- [ ] temporary files are cleaned, or `PrivateTmp=true` is set
- [ ] the logs are not going anywhere they should not
- [ ] a file over the row limit is refused with a message that makes sense
- [ ] an idle session warns after 29 minutes, then ends
- [ ] a `.rds` upload is refused

---

## Other platforms

The `app.R` above — `eq5dsuite:::eq5d_app(online = TRUE)` — is what every
platform wants, since each runs the application directory itself. What differs:

**Posit Connect** runs each app in its own process with its own `TMPDIR`, and
handles authentication, TLS and timeouts itself. Sections 2, 5 and 7 do not
apply; set the limits as environment variables on the content item, and the
upload limit with `Applications.MaxUploadSizeMB`. Because processes are not
shared between users, the value-set caution in section 4 is weaker — though it
still holds within one process.

**ShinyProxy** gives each session its own container, so temporary files and
value sets are naturally isolated and section 5's clean-up is unnecessary. Make
its `proxy.heartbeat-timeout` longer than the app's idle timeout.

**shinyapps.io** gives you no control over `TMPDIR`, the proxy or the
timeouts, and recycles instances on its own schedule. The app's own limits still
apply. Check the account's upload limit against `EQ5DSUITE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB`, and
note that the idle timeout set in the dashboard may fire before the app's
warning.
